# The Odin Project Foundations Course
## by [RossTrang](https://github.com/RossTrang)

### Objective
This repository will act as a front to the collected practical exercises of The Odin Project's [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

This repo will be pushed to Github Pages rather than publishing each exercise as its own repository and page(s), and the index.html will function as a portfolio. The exercises themselves are intended to introduce the learner to HTML and CSS, with some introductory exposure to JS and DOM manipulation.

### Exercises

Links to the exercise instructions will be listed here. Visit the hosted github page to view the output.
